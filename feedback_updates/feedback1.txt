1. Create a new HTML page and print all the data entered into login form

3. Read about lazy loading for cards page
4. Implement pagination if more than 12 cards are present on page
5. Popup - z-index, focus trap, etc
6. Commit message should be proper. Check best practices for commit message
7. Proper branch names like 
	bug/123
	enhancement/545
	task/555
8. Install ESLint plugin. There should not be any lint error in code, else it will block push operation.
